    "Data science is not a linear process. In this project, in particular, you will likely find that EDA, data cleaning, and exploratory visualizations will constantly feed back into each other. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During basic EDA, you identify many missing values in a column/feature.\n",
    "2. You consult the data dictionary and use domain knowledge to decide _what_ is meant by this missing feature.\n",
    "3. You impute a reasonable value for the missing value.\n",
    "4. You plot the distribution of your feature.\n",
    "5. You realize what you imputed has negatively impacted your data quality.\n",
    "6. You cycle back, re-load your clean data, re-think your approach, and find a better solution."
